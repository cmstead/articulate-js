# Articulate JS #

Articulate JS is a tool to help developers talk about code and write software in a conversational way. The goal is, not only, to make pairing and mobbing easier while working with Javascript, but to also create a meta-interface for developers to use which will provide the following benefits:

- Make code structure more consistent
- Separate logical flow from syntax specifics
- Reduce typing mistakes
- Automate code generation through common language and vocabulary
- Automate common small code modifications

## Installing Articulate JS ##
